# Spooky Author Identification

This project uses the Kaggle competition information from the competition
https://www.kaggle.com/c/spooky-author-identification
to build a classifier.

The data are available in the data subdirectory (5 MB)

Ideas for features to start with:
* [ ] Looking at word frequencies per author
* [ ] Look at TD-IDF weighted word frequencies per author
* [ ] Look at "parts of speech" classifier (e.g. does one author use more adjectives, etc)? Good resource for POS classification is [nltk](https://www.nltk.org/)
* [ ] Length of sentences?

We can also make multiple models, and then aggregating their predictions.
